# World-Happiness-Report-Analysis

## Project Summary
Happiness is a universal aspiration that transcends cultures, regions, and socioeconomic boundaries. The World Happiness Report provides a comprehensive analysis of global well-being by measuring happiness scores across countries. It evaluates key factors that influence happiness, including GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

This study employs a data-driven approach, combining exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical tests, and machine learning techniques. The analysis integrates data from the World Happiness Report, covering the years 2015 to 2019. Additional columns in the dataset quantify the contribution of six factors to the happiness scores. For consistency and analysis, a hypothetical baseline, Dystopia, was used as a benchmark for the lowest observed values in key happiness factors. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of global happiness trends and factors driving life satisfaction. 

## Key Questions
1. Which countries are the happiest and least happy according to the Happiness Score? 
2. Which regions have the highest and lowest average Happiness Scores? 
3. What are the key factors contributing the most to happiness in different countries? 
4. How do the happiness scores vary over the years for individual countries and regions? 
5. What is the correlation between GDP per capita and Happiness Score? 
6. Does Social Support or Freedom have a stronger impact on happiness?

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn: for data visualizations
- Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
- Folium: for creating interactive geographical maps.
- Json: for handling JSON data formats, often used in API responses.
- sklearn: for machine learning and data preprocessing tasks.
- pylab: for combining matplotlib and numpy functionalities in a single namespace.
- statsmodels.api: for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.

## Folders
The project files are stored in the following folders:
- 01 Project Management: Project brief
- 02 Data: Contains two subfolders 'Original Data' with original datasets, and 'Prepared Data' with cleaned datasets ready for analysis. (Only the final prepared data is uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.)
- 03 Scripts: Jupyter notebooks containing coding for the analysis.
- 04 Analysis: 'Visualizations' subfolder contains the graphs used for analysing and explaining insights.
- 05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Tableau and Powerpoint.
